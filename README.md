# Side Project

This is simply a side project! I'm happy that it works, and if you care enough to use it, I'm all the happier.

## Introduction

Welcome to Hologram 2.1. This project is a collection of code that I've been working on in my spare time. It may not be perfect, but it's functional and I'm proud of it. Its intended use is to make 2D images and gifs look 3D if you place a upside down pyramid structure on top of it.

## Features

- Preset images for optimal use
- An address seeker to input your own custom images
- A hide all icon to make the illusion better

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Get the web address to your desired image OR simply use the preset ones
2. Place the clear glass device on top, in between all the images, and enjoy!



Enjoy my code!
